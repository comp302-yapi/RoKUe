Goal of the game:

There are 4 halls. When you start a new game, place minimum of 3 objects to each hall. Each object gives you 10 more seconds to exit the hall. For example, if you place 3 objects, you will have 10 x 3 seconds to exit the hall.

But with each object added, the game gets harder.A key is randomly spawned in one of the objects. As the player, you need to go near the objects and click on them using your mouse to check if the key is inside.. If it is, the door opens, if it is not, you have to keep searching.

There are 3 types of monsters to challenge you:

1. Archer: Shoots when you are 4 blocks within its range.
2. Fighter: Follows when you are 4 blocks within its range. Only close combat.
3. Wizard: Teleports the key from its current object to a new random one.

There are enchantments to help you during the game. These will spawn randomly. You have to click on them to collect. You do not have to be near them:

1. Revel Map: Press *R* to use it. Creates a 4x4 yellow rectangle near the object that has the key.
2. Cloak of Protection: Press *C* to use it. Hides you from the Archer monster (NOT THE FIGHTER) for 2 seconds.
3. Heart: Clicking on it is enough. Increases your life by 1.
4. Luring Gem: Press *B*, then any of the *W A S D* keys to use it. You throw the game 2 blocks away from the direction you picked (by using W A S D). The FIGHTER monsters are attracted to this and gather around it.
